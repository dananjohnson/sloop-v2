We teamed up with Seattle-based Driveline Baseball in late 2016 to design *Hacking the Kinetic Chain: Youth Edition*. Driveline produces cutting-edge, data-driven research and training programs for youth and professional baseball players. *HTKCY* is their latest tool for developing youth pitchers—125 pages of year-round programming for players, parents, and coaches.

For the design of the book, we developed a simple but vibrant design language: cutout images, crisp typefaces, and colors and shapes inspired by baseball’s great visual history. The overall aesthetic is clean and forward-thinking with a sporty bent, fitting of Driveline’s work and research.
